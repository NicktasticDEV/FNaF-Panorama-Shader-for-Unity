## Instructions

Uhh just download the unity package and you should see a prefab with the camera and stuff

## Important

I recommend you delete every camera in the scene before you add the panorama camera

## How to change the influence of the shader and stuff

Select the Render Texture material in the project files manager, and then change the Y value of the Pixel Size
